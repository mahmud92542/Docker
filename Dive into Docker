Question: Why use Docker?

Docker makes it really easy to install and run software without worrying about setup or dependencies.

====================================

Question: What is Docker?

Docker is a set of coupled software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service products that use operating-system-level virtualization to develop and deliver software in packages called containers.

====================================

Question: How to install Docker or Linux (Mint 19.1)?

Official documentation : https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/#server

#Command for Linux Mint 19.1

#It’s completely okay to have none of these packages installed previously.

sudo apt remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc


#Make sure that APT cache is up-to-date.

sudo apt update

#By default, APT doesn’t use HTTPS. Install the following packages that will allow APT to use a repository over HTTPS.

sudo apt-get install \
apt-transport-https \
ca-certificates \
curl \
gnupg-agent \
software-properties-common

#For enabling the Docker repo, the official Docker key is important. Time to add the official GPG key of Docker into the APT keyring.

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

#Even after the successful addition of the key, it’s safe to verify the key. Run the following command

sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

#In the case of Docker, there are 3 different repositories – “stable” (recommended for everyone), “nightly” or “test”. Let’s configure the “stable” repo.

sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"

***Note – If you wish to configure any other repo (nightly or test), just change the “stable” from the command into “nightly” or “test” (without quotes).***

#Once the repositories have been added, it’s necessary to refresh the APT cache again.

sudo apt update

#Finally, install the latest version of Docker CE and containerd.

sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

=========================================

OPTIONAL

#If you’re interested in a certain version of Docker CE, then follow the following procedures.
Run the following command for listing all the available versions –

apt-cache madison docker-ce

#Once you’ve made your mind, time to install that version! Run the following command –

sudo apt-get install docker-ce=<VERSION_STRING> docker-ce-cli=<VERSION_STRING>
containerd.io

***Here, the <VERSION_STRING> should be replaced with something like “18.06.0~ce~3-0~ubuntu” (without quotes).***

==========================================

#Docker CLI

#Command to see the version
